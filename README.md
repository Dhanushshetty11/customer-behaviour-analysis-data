# customer-behaviour-analysis-data
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using historical transaction data to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. The objective is to help businesses better understand customer purchasing habits, preferences, and engagement, enabling data-driven decisions to improve customer retention, sales strategies,


🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)

Python libraries NumPy and Pandas were used extensively for cleaning and transforming the raw dataset. Pandas was used to load and manipulate large datasets efficiently, while NumPy supported numerical operations and handling missing values. The cleaning process included removing duplicate records, handling null values, correcting data types, standardizing date formats, and creating derived columns such as total purchase value and purchase frequency. These transformations ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis.

🔎 Data Analysis & Querying (SQL)

After data transformation, SQL was used to fetch and analyze structured data. SQL queries were written to perform filtering, joins, aggregations, and grouping operations on customer transactions. Key analyses such as customer segmentation, revenue contribution, purchase frequency, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis were performed using SQL. This approach allowed efficient extraction of insights from large datasets and prepared clean, structured tables for visualization.

📈 Data Visualization (Power BI)

The analyzed data was imported into Power BI to build interactive dashboards and reports. Power BI was used to create dynamic charts, graphs, and slicers that allow users to explore customer behavior across different dimensions such as time, location, and customer segments. Interactive visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and KPI cards were designed to present insights clearly and support business decision-making.
